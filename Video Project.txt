Video ProjectThis was an open project where everyone chose what they wanted to work on.I decided to do a video project. I used After Effects. It is a program I am not comfortable with, and I wanted to experiment more with it. I created 90% of the transitions and a couple of the graphics. I could have improved this video if I would have started working on it sooner and researched more on what I could do on the program. I also wish I could have figured out how to stop the glitching problem on certain parts of the video.https://youtu.be/fADBZhM6UEc
