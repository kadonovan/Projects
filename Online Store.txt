Online StoreEveryone in our class had to create a clothing product page.I was in charge of creating the pants page.https://replit.com/join/vlonknwajk-kadonovanI learned more about JavaScript and html.The goal of the project was to put all the pages together using GitHub, but the class never figured it out. Something I personally would have liked to improve is the design of my page.
